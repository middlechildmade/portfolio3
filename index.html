			<h2>Work</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Well for a few years now I've been working for myself, but my boss is a jerk and I'd like move on. I'm efficient, I know what I'm doing, and I've been doing things long enough that I've already made the stupid mistakes and learned from them. I don't overpromise, I know I can't do it all, and I'm not going to pretend that I can. Given an opportunity though, I love to dig in and learn something new. I've produced print catalogs, websites, HTML emails, flyers, postcards, sell sheets, product labels, and whatever else. I don't like buzzwords, I like good looking results that WORK.<br /><a href="/images/JSergenian-Resume.pdf" target="_blank">Check out the resume</a></p>

			<h2>Skills</h2>
		</header>
        <p><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Illustrator</strong>, <strong>InDesign</strong> of course. I don't really use Dreamweaver, I prefer a text editor like Brackets, but it wouldn't take me long to get reacclimated if necessary. I know my way around <strong>HTML &amp; CSS</strong>. I've built a number of sites on <strong>Wordpress</strong> and I've recently dug into static site generators and I've built this site using <strong>Jekyll.</strong></p>
        <p>I've built and manned tradeshow booths. Managed independent sales reps. Managed payroll, accounting, purchasing, taxes.</p>

			<h2>What Else</h2>
		</header>
        <p>Born and raised in Wisconsin. I grew up playing soccer and baseball. I played soccer while at Edgewood College but it's baseball that I still play to this day. I've become a huge fan of growing vegtables in our garden and I'm hoping to add some fruit trees so I can brew some hard cider. If given the chance I'd spend more time on the water fishing but things always seem to get in the way.</p>
